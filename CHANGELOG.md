## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Initial repo skeleton (PR-1).
- Toy 2×2×2 cartesian CPG fixture + reference topology pipeline
  (`cpg2unstructured._toy`) with integer-invariant smoke tests (PR-2).
- GRDECL reader (`read_grdecl`, `Grdecl`) supporting DIMENS / SPECGRID /
  COORD / ZCORN / ACTNUM with `--` comments and `N*VALUE` run-length
  expansion. Unknown keywords are collected on `Grdecl.unrecognized`
  rather than raised. Domain exceptions in `cpg2unstructured._errors`
  (PR-3).
